Step 2: Configure Zabbix agent on Linux OS
Keep in mind that in this tutorial I will use a Zabbix server with IP address 192.168.5.43 to monitor a Linux server called l01mylab that has IP address 192.168.5.114 – don’t forget to change those settings to match your environment. Feel free to check the official Zabbix documentation if you need more information about Zabbix agent configuration parameters.

Let’s update some Zabbix agent configuration parameters, open Zabbix agent configuration file with with your favorite text editor:

sudo nano /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf
And update these parameters:

Server=192.168.5.43
ServerActive=192.168.5.43
HostMetadata=Linux
HostnameItem=system.hostname
In the “Server” and “ServerActive” parameters put the IP address of your Zabbix server or proxy!

“HostMetadata” can be anything, any description of the system or a word that can help you later on in auto-registration process on the Zabbix frontend.
